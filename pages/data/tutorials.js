        Things you must know before building Software product based Startup <br><br>
        1.Software solutions are only useful if it boost the operational productivity of the system.<br/><br/>
        2.The main subject of entrepreneurship is social science, if you dont understand people then there 
        is no way for you to build anything useful because people are the user of the product and they will only 
        pay for what they consider valuable. Engineering is only useful in scale. You cant scale non valuable thing 
        in the market and understanding what is valuable and non valuable requires a deep understanding of human behaviour
        and civilisations not software engineering. Scaling also requires the person who can maintain the scale of the
        organisation as well. Process of improving the market value of any product/service is called marketing.<br/><br/>
        3.If a project leader did the requirement analysis improperly then it cant be fixed from the bottom thats 
        why meetings are more important than work and main task of a leader is to keep people from different departments 
        on the same page which means his ability to communicate and learn new things in the given domain should be higher 
        so that he can make right decisions for the project and involved stakeholders including clients, investors and employees.<br/><br/>
