        Questions:"What you must know before building software product based startup ?",
        tags:"#software #business #civilization",
        Answers:`
        Things you must know before building Software product based Startup <br><br>
        1.Software solutions are only useful if it boost the operational productivity of the system.<br/><br/>
        2.The main subject of entrepreneurship is social science, if you dont understand people then there 
        is no way for you to build anything useful because people are the user of the product and they will only 
        pay for what they consider valuable. Engineering is only useful in scale. You cant scale non valuable thing 
        in the market and understanding what is valuable and non valuable requires a deep understanding of human behaviour
        and civilisations not software engineering. Scaling also requires the person who can maintain the scale of the
        organisation as well. Process of improving the market value of any product/service is called marketing.<br/><br/>
        3.If a project leader did the requirement analysis improperly then it cant be fixed from the bottom thats 
        why meetings are more important than work and main task of a leader is to keep people from different departments 
        on the same page which means his ability to communicate and learn new things in the given domain should be higher 
        so that he can make right decisions for the project and involved stakeholders including clients, investors and employees.

        Questions:"What is the importance of cultural understanding in business ?",
        tags:"#culture #business",
        Answers:`
        You might be wondering like what is the importance of cultural understanding in business. 
        It took me so long to understand " People are the user of the product and they only pay for 
        what they consider valuable not what is actually valuable, values are determined by the culture. 
        Culture is the most important factor that's why when big corporations or big brands enter new country,
        the first thing they do is destroy culture of another country and promote their own culture so that 
        they can grow their brands more conveniently. Lets understand this with an example, ever wonder why burger, 
        pizza etc and all these kinds of fast foods are much costlier than Indian fast foods like vada pav, aaloo tikki, 
        pani poori etc on an average. Most of the times the cost of raw material are also similar but the difference 
        in people in Indian think american food is more valuable than Indian food because of rise of influence of western 
        culture on Indians. If you go more deep in this you will find answers of questions like "Why English is everywhere 
        even when not needed, Why people assume English speaking person more educated or intellectual than local native language 
        speaking person" etc etc. <br>
        <br>
        Lets take one more example<br>
        American Brand's Shirt<br>
        Cost : 1000<br>
        TAX : 1000<br>
        Selling Price : 5000<br><br>
        3000 profit goes to American Investors which they can 
        use for their own country's development
        <br><br>
        Indian Brand's Shirt<br>
        Cost : 1000<br>
        TAX : 500<br>
        Selling Price : 5000<br><br>
        3500 profit goes to Indian Investors which they can use 
        for India's development.<br><br>
        
        If quality of both products are almost similar and still people buy foreign brands then it means 
        Indians value american brand more than Indian brands maybe because most products which american brand produce 
        are better than Indian brands or maybe because Indian brands are not considered as a status symbol. 
        <br><br>
        American brands can't influence Indians if Indians don't consider American culture superior then their own culture. 
        To establish American culture as superior they show a pseudo american culture reality in their movies and TV shows. 
        America is not what we see american serials or movies just like India is not what we see in Indian movies and serials. 
        American's show that there life is awesome and Indian's believe it so blindly and in fact the producer director etc 
        also write that statement "All characters appearing in this work are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, 
        is purely coincidental" still people ignore that thing and there is no real way to verify that their life is awesome or not if 
        one doesn't talk to an American one to one which is very difficult. Indian's blindly believe them due to improper education. 
        In those serials they promote their own brands which create influence and force Indian's to buy american brands as they are considered cool.

        Questions:"How ego of common man is always bigger than success of businessman ?",
        tags:"#business #culture #civilization",
        Answers:`
        The central thing in entrepreneurship is "customer is the king" but who are the customers, it is common person who makes impulsive decisions and 
        if we make them king then everything become unstable. Success in capitalism = ability to sell more or ability to sell for more. In both cases society 
        will become unstable. Lets assume a scenario, suppose large number of people suffering from a disease and pharmaceutical company start selling vaccine 
        in 10,000 instead of 1000 then the whole economy go out of balance if government don't provide subsidy then people will die in large numbers which can 
        potentially create violence and make situation even worse. People need higher purpose than convenient survival if we want to establish any stable community 
        but if a system which says fulfilment of people desires are the highest even if their desires are stupid then we will get what are getting right now a world 
        with problems like climate change, inequality, diseases and mental disorders. If you become leader in such system people will keep you successful only if you 
        fulfil their desires instead of doing their welfare whether it is political or entrepreneurial. <br> <br>
        Tell me who is bigger "ego" or "selected leader" ? <br><br>
        If a politician made wrong policy from the top or did wrong financial distribution of resources then no bureaucrat from the bottom can do the right thing as 
        bureaucrat run out of resources to execute right things. Politicians don't write their manifesto's by consulting bureaucrats or with the help of domain experts 
        and even if they write a very logical manifesto by consulting bureaucrats then people will not give their votes because other party will write an over-promising 
        attractive manifesto for people to win election. This is all result of poor education system of the country where people don't know what is actually valuable and 
        what is not that's why burger which bring diseases are much costlier than books which potentially change people's life. If politicians take wrong decision from the 
        top than no bureaucrat can change it from the bottom, if people value wrong things from the top then politicians with good intention can't win and even if they somehow 
        manage to win people won't let them execute anything. What bureaucrat can do is to execute policies efficiently but what will people get after execution of wrong policies 
        more efficiently. <br> <br>
        So, we can't say efficient execution of anything (achieving so called success by selling 10 bananas instead of 2) is very noble thing or real purpose of life. 
        The direction of execution is more important than execution efficiency for fulfilment in life.

        Questions:"What is Price Law ? Why confidence is considered more important than clarity for mediocre life and how it destroyed us ?",
        tags:"#civilization #business",
        Answers:`
        Price law : It states 50% of useful work is done by square root of amount of people in any domain.<br><br>
        "0.5 million out of 1 million research done by top 1000 researchers" hold true for various other domains as well.<br><br>
        if X = 100 then 95% of work will be done by 40 people or 40%.<br>
        if X = 10,000 then 95% of work will be done by 400 people or 4%.<br>
        What does it mean ?<br><br>
        If you work in an organisation with more than 10,000 members you may succeed even if you don't know anything about the work or 
        organisation in depth. Most part of journey for most people on average will be spend on going from person with rank 10000 to rank 3000, 
        that's why people remain clueless even after becoming successful. <br><br>        
        That's why people value confidence and blind faith over clarity which 
        destroy the intelligence of society and that's why we see world filled with stupidity and wrong definitions, it could be changed with 
        the help of technology as it can allow X people to communicate with square root of X effectively and we are doing it as well 
        ed tech is the biggest technology which took advantage of this fact consciously or unconsciously.

        Questions:"How AI and Blockchain can transform our society ?",
        tags:"#ai #blockchain #civilization",
        Answers:`
        If you live in the jungle of Africa you need intelligence and wisdom even for the survival but if you move 
        to any city of Africa you don't need it that much and in europe you can survive even if you are not mentally stable 
        due to good healthcare facilities. <br><br>
        What does it mean? It means human intelligence is so much valuable than anything and it should be utilized for important work, not just for survival.
        The production abilities of humans go very far in this 21st century that's why all new major societal innovation are happening on proper resources distribution
        like uber, airbnb etc, we call them platform. Platforms in profit oriented capitalistic society created a huge problem of power distribution amongst the people 
        as it gives control of society to influencers and platform owners instead of distributing it to right people who can take better decisions for the improvement 
        of society in all aspects. 
        <br><br>
        The problem of identification of right people for right purpose can be solved by Artificial Intelligence and the problem regarding 
        correctness of their credibility can be solved by blockchain

        Questions:"Why does everything evolved like that in human civilization ? ",
        tags:"#civilization",
        Answers:`
        We were chimpanzee for millions of years and there were only two life purpose (i) survival (ii) reproduction. 
        We develop hunger - so that we don't run out of energy and die, greed - so that we don't have to worry about future up to a certain level, 
        fear - so that we will runaway if we try to jump from height or we encounter any big animal, anger - to fight things with physical strength 
        to prevent ourselves for survival and attachments - so that you can protect people you care about and sexual desires - so that population keeps 
        growing because most new born die. This works well in the jungle setup and we are very close to chimpanzee even humans DNA is only fractionally different. 
        Few thousand years ago, we change the entire setup to civilisations but the body remain trained or conditioned for the jungle as biological conditioning 
        is millions of years old and the new social setup we created is few thousand years old and our own ability to not follow conditioning is done only for 
        20 years by parenting and education that's why biology wins so easily and holds a major influence over our decisions. 
        The major problem is chimpanzee has the all power and if you suppress it too much the wrong way then there might be possibility that it will not give you power to do anything.
        Rise ahead of desires is only done via spiritual education and training. Spirituality is all about leaving conditioning and gaining consciousness.

        Questions:"Why people can't love those whom they can't control ? why they are always eager to name or define things ? How does it affect our relationships ? ",
        tags:"#love #relationships",
        Answers:`
        (i) People can't love the person whom they can't control or predict more often because love is just for the name in the relationship but the real thing is control that's how humans 
        are biologically wired that's why we find so difficult learning or adapting new things even if it is right for us in the long term. We actually don't know what is love which is the 
        biggest problem. If you give bottle to alcoholic person then he/she might bless you and say good things but if you refuse then they will say bad things. Love is keeping the bottle away 
        and also took that person to the real doctor instead of claiming yourself as the doctor for the welfare of other. Love is not about fulfilment of expectations of other but about the welfare of other.
        Do we actually approach things like that or we are just ignorant or do things superficially.<br><br> 
        (ii) People avoid communication and questioning, one of the great way to avoid questioning is to name or define things as quickly as possible without questioning so that there will be no uncertainty 
        this is also biological conditioning, earlier in jungle, chimpanzee need to name and form the image of anything which comes nearby as prey or predator for their survival. We talk to the people 
        on the basis of image we formed about them instead of actually communicating with them and collecting real data, you can checkout your history it is there even in your chats you can see this.
        Conditioning is million years old and the new social structure we created is few thousand years old and our education and parenting is only 20 year old that's why <b>whenever we loose awareness we follow biology.</b>

        Questions:"What does human really chase in life according to gautam buddha ? ",
        tags:"#life #desires",
        Answers:`
        <b>According to Buddha,</b> Human's body and mind are designed to chase excitement at the deepest level. 
        Superficially, it looks like a person is chasing money, power, fame, person, material, vacation, experiences, drugs etc 
        but excitement is the core of every pursuit. <br><br>
        Excitement has it's validity, ever wonder why same song which you liked the most once no longer made impression on you right now 
        and why the same loop of "I don't like this" to "I love this song" to "going crazy about it" never stopped ever since. 
        Songs gets replaced but the story of not liking to going crazy and playing in loops doesn't. 
        It is the proof of buddha's above statement and it isn't limited to just songs we all know it is also found when we learn new thing, met new person etc, 
        I hope now buddha's statement start making more sense. <br><br>
        Excitement comes from working in one's priority is known as happiness and in opposite direction of priorities is known as sadness. <br><br>
        In both cases people are blinded by the excitement and never gain satisfaction because consciousness get damaged or decayed in excitement and satisfaction 
        came from living a life with higher consciousness. Obviously, the frequency of excitement one can get by entertainment is much higher than one can gain from 
        the work that's why we choose entertainment over education.

        Questions:"Why do humans ask questions ? What does Krishna said about the real source of all desires ? Is there any liberation possible ? ",
        tags:"#life #desires",
        Answers:`
        According to Krishna, We ask questions because we want to fulfil our desires whether we know about the source of desire or not but these desires are the one which controls us from the core
        <br><br>

        Worshippers of the celestial gods take birth amongst the celestial gods, worshippers of the ancestors go to the ancestors, worshippers of ghosts take birth amongst such beings, 
        and My devotees come to Me alone.
        <br><br>  
        - Geeta 9:25
        <br><br>
        Those who worship perfectionists gain perfection (used for all specialists like people who follow the experts gain perfection, random advice never works, always ask the expert), 
        those who worship authority gain authority (used for authoritarians as people get authority by following footsteps of the person in authority for a given situation, it could be 
        you as authority in your home, community, state or country), those who worship material gain control over material (used for scientists as scientist play with material and know 
        what's inside and create an entirely new way to do thing but still for fulfilment of desires) and those who worship consciousness gain awareness and stop overvaluing desires by 
        observing the same old boring story of it's birth and death. (you will leave all the compulsiveness and become more mentally stable due to raise in consciousness happen by not 
        chasing desires or dreams blindly without questioning, by understanding the nature of desire that it can't be fulfilled and it always changes and not that reliable you won't value 
        it more than your consciousness as nothing is more important than that for you). You can consider it like universal equation or a framework to answer you question in a way which bring 
        more stability and sanity or "dharma" in everyone's life according to Krishna.

        Answers:`
        The scientific equipment can only magnify the senses and our senses can't capture everything. 
        Just like if you ask bat which colour of shirt I am wearing then it will say I don't know what 
        is colour as bat doesn't have senses to experience colours. Science can't perceive anything beyond 
        senses that's why Socrates said I know nothing because everything is subjective with respect to the senses of observer 
        and can't be objectified absolutely, objectification is the technique developed by humans to make use of things,

        Prediction is not knowing but prediction helps to simply things in order to build innovative products 
        which improve our comfort. Just because one knows how to drive a motorcycle doesn't mean he actually know what a motorcycle is ..

        Questions:"What every purpose is identity dependent ? What is life purpose ?",
        tags:"#purpose #life",
        Answers:`
        Purpose of Life.<br>
        Lets break it into "Life" and "Purpose", Purpose is identity dependent. If I identify myself as a student then only my purpose is to study,
        If I identify myself as a father then only my purpose is to take care of children. If I identify myself as a scientist then only my purpose 
        is to discover new thing. We identify ourselves with things before we pursue things. Identity always comes before significant achievements. 
        For life, if you identify life as the body then your purpose is to take care of it. If you identify life as the mind then your purpose is to 
        keep it in the best mental state but if I cut or remove certain body part you remain yourself and even if I smash iron rod on your head you may 
        loose memory but you remain yourself unless you damage the neural network. What is that self which is not body nor mind is you or the consciousness, 
        it is the true identity of yours or the best possible identity, body and mind exists to serve the conscious or real you. So, if you are consciousness 
        then your purpose is to stay in consciousness or higher level of consciousness. - This is the explanation by Osho / J Krishnamurti etc. and also written 
        in various religious scriptures like Geeta.
