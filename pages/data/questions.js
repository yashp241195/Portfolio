        Things you must know before building Software product based Startup <br><br>
        1.Software solutions are only useful if it boost the operational productivity of the system.<br/><br/>
        2.The main subject of entrepreneurship is social science, if you dont understand people then there 
        is no way for you to build anything useful because people are the user of the product and they will only 
        pay for what they consider valuable. Engineering is only useful in scale. You cant scale non valuable thing 
        in the market and understanding what is valuable and non valuable requires a deep understanding of human behaviour
        and civilisations not software engineering. Scaling also requires the person who can maintain the scale of the
        organisation as well. Process of improving the market value of any product/service is called marketing.<br/><br/>
        3.If a project leader did the requirement analysis improperly then it cant be fixed from the bottom thats 
        why meetings are more important than work and main task of a leader is to keep people from different departments 
        on the same page which means his ability to communicate and learn new things in the given domain should be higher 
        so that he can make right decisions for the project and involved stakeholders including clients, investors and employees.<br/><br/>

        Questions:"what is the importance of cultural understanding in business",

        Answers:`
        You might be wondering like what is the importance of cultural understanding in business. 
        It took me so long to understand " People are the user of the product and they only pay for 
        what they consider valuable not what is actually valuable, values are determined by the culture. 
        Culture is the most important factor that's why when big corporations or big brands enter new country,
        the first thing they do is destroy culture of another country and promote their own culture so that 
        they can grow their brands more conveniently. Lets understand this with an example, ever wonder why burger, 
        pizza etc and all these kinds of fast foods are much costlier than Indian fast foods like vada pav, aaloo tikki, 
        pani poori etc on an average. Most of the times the cost of raw material are also similar but the difference 
        in people in Indian think american food is more valuable than Indian food because of rise of influence of western 
        culture on Indians. If you go more deep in this you will find answers of questions like "Why English is everywhere 
        even when not needed, Why people assume English speaking person more educated or intellectual than local native language 
        speaking person" etc etc. <br>
        <br>
        Lets take one more example<br>
        American Brand's Shirt<br>
        Cost : 1000<br>
        TAX : 1000<br>
        Selling Price : 5000<br><br>
        3000 profit goes to American Investors which they can 
        use for their own country's development
        <br><br>
        Indian Brand's Shirt<br>
        Cost : 1000<br>
        TAX : 500<br>
        Selling Price : 5000<br><br>
        3500 profit goes to Indian Investors which they can use 
        for India's development.<br><br>
        
        If quality of both products are almost similar and still people buy foreign brands then it means 
        Indians value american brand more than Indian brands maybe because most products which american brand produce 
        are better than Indian brands or maybe because Indian brands are not considered as a status symbol. 
        <br><br>
        American brands can't influence Indians if Indians don't consider American culture superior then their own culture. 
        To establish American culture as superior they show a pseudo american culture reality in their movies and TV shows. 
        America is not what we see american serials or movies just like India is not what we see in Indian movies and serials. 
        American's show that there life is awesome and Indian's believe it so blindly and in fact the producer director etc 
        also write that statement "All characters appearing in this work are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, 
        is purely coincidental" still people ignore that thing and there is no real way to verify that their life is awesome or not if 
        one doesn't talk to an American one to one which is very difficult. Indian's blindly believe them due to improper education. 
        In those serials they promote their own brands which create influence and force Indian's to buy american brands as they are considered cool.
