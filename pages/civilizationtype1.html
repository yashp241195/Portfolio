    <h2> Upgrading to Civilization Type 1 </h2>
    <div style=" width: 700px;" id="main">
        There are various levels of civilization, majorly we can classify them into 3 levels. 
        It can go beyond level 3 as well based on the scale invented by russian scientist Nikolai Kardashev 
        but it will be useless for us to discuss beyond level 3 without attaining the level 3.

        <ul>
            <li>
               <b> Type 0 Civilization (L1) </b> : energy demand per person isn't met sufficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b> Type 1 Civilization (L2) </b> : energy demand per person met sufficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b> Type 2 Civilization (L3) </b> : person evolve into self sustainable cyborg 
               (human with organic and biomechatronic body parts which possess automatic self healing capabilities). 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div>
            Type 1 Civilization can be constructed with the following approach :
            <ul>
                <li>Civilization possess huge amount of energy for every individual – Kardeshev (Scientist) </li> 
                <li>Civilization possess great level of intelligence where people don’t use resources unnecessarily – Buddha's (Spiritualist) </li>
                <li>Civilization possess great intelligent(AI) and reliable (Blockchain) infrastructure for resource distribution. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>  
        
        </div>
        <div>
            How to deal with the Pareto distribution, it says the 50% of the useful work is done by square root of X. Price's law, De Solla Price was 
            the one who discovered this thing in all creative domain with the help of Pareto distribution.
            It also suggests that only 100 people out of 10,000 did 50% of the useful work or work in the right direction or we can say 1% people did 50% of work 
            and if we reward people that basis then it will generate the kind of wealth disparity we see in capitalistic world.
        </div>
        <div>
            <br>
            He discovered that top 1000 scientists published 500K or 50% of researches out of 1 million, it also holds true for wealth distribution that’s why all 
            3000 billionaires owns more wealth than bottom 4.6 billion people.

            <b>Failed Solution by Soviet Union : </b> 
            <br><br>
            Soviet Union came up with the solution like restarting the entire system by making the starting line same for everyone but that experiment failed miserably 
            as Pareto distribution comes up again as a natural law. Few farmers end up holding all the production because they were efficient not because they were corrupt 
            and nobody understood why same wealth inequality happened again. So, people started spreading rumour about these rich farmers and then villagers end up killing 
            these rich individuals but still it doesn't solve the problem. Few years later, due to incapability to produce food efficiently almost 6 Million people died due 
            to famine and Soviet got collapsed.

            <b>Welfare State Solution by Nordic countries : </b> 
            <br><br>
            After finding oils and natural resources these countries could have spent their money on other non essential things but 
            their leaders spent it education, health care and various other kinds of infrastructures which allows individuals to contribute 
            better because they understood the fact that one infrastructure allow development of another infrastructure and cost of doing 
            anything without a proper infrastructure is exponentially higher than cost of doing things with proper infrastructure.
            <br/><br/>
            For example, if you wish to start a taxi business like Uber but there exists no proper road. Will that business work? 
            No. So, Uber is highly dependent upon the infrastructure of road.
            <br/><br/>
            They invested heavily on the educational and health care infrastructure as they are the most critical component of the society. Improper health care and improper education breeds crime, corruption and injustice. 
            <b>
            Cost of fighting organized crime, corruption and injustice is exponentially greater than cost of providing better education and health care over period of decades. 
            </b>
            <br/><br/>
            Better education and better health care :
            <ul>
                <li>
                    make a person more creative, productive and skilled which statistically result in exponential improvement in productivity of systems and ultimately more profits and economic growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    make a person more open to new ideas and new people and ultimately result into  higher politically stable society. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            Similar form of implementations are done by Europe, US and various parts of the world in order to reduce the absolute 
            poverty and formed various groups like IMF, UN, World Bank etc.
            It succeeded as well up to a certain level. IT and Internet revolution also improves the speed of the entire process.
            With the help of mobile phone, mobile apps and better internet connectivity businesses and government are able to reach 
            indivduals within milliseconds.
            <br/><br/>
            To uplift people, we need a mecahinsim to identify people and store their records in order to plan their upliftment. 
            Before computer technology, people do such things by keeping track records on notebooks which is highly vulnerable to corruption.
            Operational speed of systems got improved exponentially and corruption got minimized with the help of digital systems but still 
            database administrator holds to potential to change or corrupt the data. This is the limitation of centralized system.
            <br/><br/>
            In 2008, with bitcoin launch, blockchain technology remain no longer a concept. In 2015, Etherium helps people build custom 
            smart contracts.
            <br/><br/>
            The problem of identification of right people for right purpose can be solved by Artificial Intelligence and 
            the problem regarding correctness of it's credibility can be solved by block-chain. We can provide that benefit
            to everyone with the help of mobile phone and internet very efficiently in the current modern economy.
            It means we have the capability to target the individual and plan their upliftment with the help of mobile apps and internet.

            Humans need to work for their survival and reproduce 
            for survival of their species, after jungle age
            people started working together in order to improve 
            probability of their survival 
            by improving productivity with the help of tools and 
            methods and also by making a social structure for faster 
            and better collaborative decisions. Building new tools and methods 
            and making decisions on behalf of others requires thinking abilities 
            and very few people have 
            great thinking abilities and they are 
            responsible for the development of humanity.
            We can improve our survival by utilizing their thoughts.  
            For reproduction and survival of species, people created 
            the institution of marriage which increase the probability of
            survival for both partners and also          
            provides stable environment for upbringing of their children.  
            <br/><br/>
            For survival we need 
            <br/>- a platform which help people work together more efficiently. -Economy
            <br/>- a platform which help people utilize power of thoughts 
            for making faster and better collaborative decision. -Administration
            <br/>For survival of species or reproduction we need 
            <br/>- a platform which help people find better partner. -Marriage
            <br/><br/>
            All other infrastructures are dependent upon these fundamental 
            infrastructure of survival. 
            <br/>
            <br/> For finding better work opportunities we have created Workoso.app 
            <br/> For making better collaborative decision we have created linkhelp.app 
            <br/> For finding better partner we have created dateze.app
