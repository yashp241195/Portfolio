        There are various levels of civilization, majorly we can classify them into 3 levels. 
        It can go beyond level 3 as well based on the scale invented by russian scientist Nikolai Kardashev 
        but it will be useless for us to discuss beyond level 3 without attaining the level 3.

        <ul>
            <li>
               <b> Type 0 Civilization (L1) </b> : energy demand per person isn't met sufficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b> Type 1 Civilization (L2) </b> : energy demand per person met sufficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b> Type 2 Civilization (L3) </b> : person evolve into self sustainable cyborg 
               (human with organic and biomechatronic body parts which possess automatic self healing capabilities). 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            Type 1 Civilization can be constructed with the following approach :
            <ul>
                <li>Civilization possess huge amount of energy for every individual – Kardeshev (Scientist) </li> 
                <li>Civilization possess great level of intelligence where people don’t use resources unnecessarily – Buddha's (Spiritualist) </li>
                <li>Civilization possess great infrastructure for resource distribution. (AI+Block-chain based). </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            Q. Even after good resources and power distribution in developed countries still people aren’t free from compulsive behavior and trying their best 
            to recreate problems of Type 0 Civilization as fighting them gives purpose to their life psychologically and keep them away from compulsiveness?
            <br><br>
            A. The real problem lies inside the body and mind of human, even after a good resource and power distribution we still found ourselves into similar and 
            sophisticated version of Type 0 Civilization problems due to animalistic tendencies which were needed for survival in jungle days (days when we were chimpanzee) 
            when we were very less intelligent. The animalistic tendencies like “lust /greed /anger /attachment” mentioned by Krishna in Geeta and mentioned in various other 
            religious scriptures re-create the same Type 0 Civilization in mind and ultimately result into lots of stress and anxiety because supply of animalistic tendencies 
            remain the same but it's usage become almost null as the difference between DNA of humans and chimpanzee isn't even 3%. This is literally psychosomatic which means the
            disease inside mind will translate into the body, that's why healthcare (physical and mental) even after material development where no one is starving is still a 
            very big issue. 
            <br><br>
            This can be solved by two approaches : 
            <ul >
                <li> 
                    Krishna mentioned in Geeta you can’t control tendencies easily but you can control your senses by limiting the inputs intelligently 
                    so that mind doesn’t process and produce extreme chemical imbalance. With spiritual practices and meditation we can achieve that mental 
                    and physical state where we didn't get into stress or anxiety with anything happening outside because chemical imbalances aren't created  
                    by input but with the understanding we derived from input. If someone on road dies you won't cry that much but if that person is your
                    family member or friend then you cry. The incident happened from outside is same for everyone but it has different affect on different people due to 
                    attachment exists in the mind with the dead person.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    With Elon Musk’s Neuralink or something like that which can establish control and regulation over production of different hormones and prevent the chemical imbalance.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                The loss in compulsiveness will create a highly mentally stable human being who can observe things and it enable the possibilities for becoming a highly aware person.
                <br><br>
                The growth in awareness might end up into possibilities such as :
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Start living without worries as lower compulsiveness and higher awareness allow people to see social norms which stress them out as a joke.
                        It might end up into buddha's lifestyle (nothing is as important as you think, absence of so called important things can lead to death but 
                        it's presence and abundance won't fulfill you the way it promised. Just like when we are hungry, we see food everywhere, it lead us to worship 
                        the food in ancient time but now people don’t even care as it is available in abundance). People’s interest in accumulation of things will disappear 
                        and it’s true up to a certain degree. Do you feel the need of accumulation of food for an entire year in your home? Absolutely Not. A good distribution 
                        system will reduce the need of accumulation and this is what Type 1 Civilization promised. A version of it is known as Marxism/Communism/Socialism etc 
                        as well but it is incomplete as it doesn't include the fundamental questions mentioned in Geeta about animalistic tendencies like greed/anger/lust/attachment 
                        which were foundation of human survival in jungle days and remain silent on the mental stability.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finding the way to create a self healing body with genetic engineering or creating an alternate body structure which requires less energy to operate and alternate 
                        food and also doesn’t include natural senses and tendencies which created all the trouble. The whole thing could be managed with by AI robots who posses the ability to re-create 
                        themselves and other kinds of robots automatically and accordingly. The whole thing can be operated by some kind of nuclear power as well so that we can sustain our life for 
                        millions of years and travel across the different galaxies or anywhere in the space. This is what Type 2 Civilization has promised, an independent self sustaining life.
                    </li>    
                </ul>
                <div>
                    Maybe with rise in awareness, one can ask why move here and there, it is all similar material every where and only senses which exists inside my body is accessing everything not the real me. On changing the set of senses from human to owl the same set of events happened with me make no sense.
                    <br><br>
                    There will be no meaning of experiences as experience can’t happen without senses, senses create experiences and they aren’t real. They are fun just like computer games. With the help of advancements made in Type 2 Civilization we can alter our senses from human to some other animal/plant which 
                    potentially enable us to experience how plants/animals/insects etc actually feel or experience. It will be a hell lot more fun than our current life but still it has the limitation because with rise in awareness and a lifespan of million year one can literally see the uselessness of the existence 
                    of life itself and change the perspective of life from something very serious to a fun computer game where you just play. Maybe this whole setup is just for fun and not about being dead serious and nothing is as valuable is it appears. Maybe this whole Civilization 2.0 isn’t needed at all, we can 
                    achieve a peaceful life by improving awareness and E.Q. of entire society.
                    The place where E.Q. needed the most is relationships with others, what will happen if two people with higher E.Q. starts the family, the root cause of major problems might disappear.
                    <br><br>
                    Quite difficult to predict what will happen if Civilization 2.0 implemented, not sure whether we can see this in our lifetime but Civilization Type 1.0 is possible to implement and even something we need right now 
                    in order to save planet earth from destruction due to excessive exploitation of natural resources.
