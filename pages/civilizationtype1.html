    <h2> Upgrading to Civilization Type 1 </h2>
    <div style=" width: 700px;" id="main">
        There are various levels of civilization, majorly we can classify them into 3 levels. 
        It can go beyond level 3 as well based on the scale invented by russian scientist Nikolai Kardashev 
        but it will be useless for us to discuss beyond level 3 without attaining the level 3.

        <ul>
            <li>
               <b> Type 0 Civilization (L1) </b> : energy demand per person isn't met sufficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b> Type 1 Civilization (L2) </b> : energy demand per person met sufficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b> Type 2 Civilization (L3) </b> : person evolve into self sustainable cyborg 
               (human with organic and biomechatronic body parts which possess automatic self healing capabilities). 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div>
            Type 1 Civilization can be constructed with the following approach :
            <ul>
                <li>Civilization possess huge amount of energy for every individual – Kardeshev (Scientist) </li> 
                <li>Civilization possess great level of intelligence where people don’t use resources unnecessarily – Buddha's (Spiritualist) </li>
                <li>Civilization possess great intelligent(AI) and reliable (Blockchain) infrastructure for resource distribution. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>  
        
        </div>
        <div>
            How to deal with the Pareto distribution, it says the 50% of the useful work is done by square root of X. Price's law, De Solla Price was 
            the one who discovered this thing in all creative domain with the help of Pareto distribution.
            
        </div>
        <div>
            It also suggests that only 100 people out of 10,000 did 50% of the useful work or work in the right direction or we can say 1% people did 50% of work 
            and if we reward people that basis then it will generate the kind of wealth disparity we see in capitalistic world.
        </div>
        <div>
            He discovered that top 1000 scientists published 500K or 50% of researches out of 1 million, it also holds true for wealth distribution that’s why all 
            3000 billionaires owns more wealth than bottom 4.6 billion people.
        </div>
        <div>
            Failed Solution by Soviet Union : 
            Soviet Union came up with the solution like restarting the entire system by making the starting line same for everyone but that experiment failed miserably 
            as Pareto distribution comes up again as a natural law. Few farmers end up holding all the production because they were efficient not because they were corrupt 
            and nobody understood why same wealth inequality happened again. So, people started spreading rumour about these rich farmers and then villagers end up killing 
            these rich individuals but still it doesn’t solve the problem. Few years later, due to incapability to produce food efficiently almost 6 Million people died due 
            to famine and later entire system got collapsed.
