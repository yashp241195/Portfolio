    <h2> Upgrading to Civilization Type 1 </h2>
    <div style=" width: 700px;" id="main">
        There are various levels of civilization, majorly we can classify them into 3 levels. 
        It can go beyond level 3 as well based on the scale invented by russian scientist Nikolai Kardashev 
        but it will be useless for us to discuss beyond level 3 without attaining the level 3.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <div>
            Type 1 Civilization can be constructed with the following approach :
            <ul>
                <li>Civilization possess huge amount of energy for every individual – Kardeshev (Scientist) </li> 
                <li>Civilization possess great level of intelligence where people don’t use resources unnecessarily – Buddha's (Spiritualist) </li>
                <li>Civilization possess great intelligent(AI) and reliable (Blockchain) infrastructure for resource distribution. </li>

            How to deal with the Pareto distribution, it says the 50% of the useful work is done by square root of X. Price's law, De Solla Price was 
            the one who discovered this thing in all creative domain with the help of Pareto distribution.
            It also suggests that only 100 people out of 10,000 did 50% of the useful work or work in the right direction or we can say 1% people did 50% of work 
            and if we reward people that basis then it will generate the kind of wealth disparity we see in capitalistic world.

            He discovered that top 1000 scientists published 500K or 50% of researches out of 1 million, it also holds true for wealth distribution that’s why all 
            3000 billionaires owns more wealth than bottom 4.6 billion people.

            <b>Failed Solution by Soviet Union : </b> 
            <br><br>
            Soviet Union came up with the solution like restarting the entire system by making the starting line same for everyone but that experiment failed miserably 
            as Pareto distribution comes up again as a natural law. Few farmers end up holding all the production because they were efficient not because they were corrupt 
            and nobody understood why same wealth inequality happened again. So, people started spreading rumour about these rich farmers and then villagers end up killing 
            these rich individuals but still it doesn't solve the problem. Few years later, due to incapability to produce food efficiently almost 6 Million people died due 
            to famine and Soviet got collapsed.

            <b>Welfare State Solution by Nordic countries : </b> 
            <br><br>
            After finding oils and natural resources these countries could have spent their money on other non essential things but 
            their leaders spent it education, health care and various other kinds of infrastructures which allows individuals to contribute 
            better because they understood the fact that one infrastructure allow development of another infrastructure and cost of doing 
            anything without a proper infrastructure is exponentially higher than cost of doing things with proper infrastructure.
            <br/><br/>
            For example, if you wish to start a taxi business like Uber but there exists no proper road. Will that business work? 
            No. So, Uber is highly dependent upon the infrastructure of road.
            <br/><br/>
            They invested heavily on the educational and health care infrastructure as they are the most critical component of the society. Improper health care and improper education breeds crime, corruption and injustice. 
            <b>
            Cost of fighting organized crime, corruption and injustice is exponentially greater than cost of providing better education and health care over period of decades. 
            </b>
            <br/><br/>
            Better education and better health care :
            <ul>
                <li>
                    make a person more creative, productive and skilled which statistically result in exponential improvement in productivity of systems and ultimately more profits and economic growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    make a person more open to new ideas and new people and ultimately result into  higher politically stable society. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            Humans need to work for their survival and reproduce 
            for survival of their species, after jungle age
            people started working together in order to improve 
            probability of their survival 
            by improving productivity with the help of tools and 
            methods and also by making a social structure for faster 
            and better collaborative decisions. Building new tools and methods 
            and making decisions on behalf of others requires thinking abilities 
            and very few people have 
            great thinking abilities and they are 
            responsible for the development of humanity.
            We can improve our survival by utilizing their thoughts.  
            For reproduction and survival of species, people created 
            the institution of marriage which increase the probability of
            survival for both partners and          
            provides stable environment for upbringing of their children.
            <br/><br/>
            For survival we need 
            <ul>
                <li> a platform which help people work together more efficiently. - Economy </li>
                <li> a platform which help people utilize power of thoughts for making faster and better collaborative decision. - Administration </li>
            </ul>
            For survival of species or reproduction we need 
            <ul>
                <li> a platform which help people find better partner. - Dating </li>
            </ul>
            All other infrastructures are dependent upon these fundamental 
            infrastructure of survival.

            To uplift people, we need a mecahinsim to identify people and store their records in order to plan their upliftment. 
            Before computer technology, people do such things by keeping track records on notebooks which is highly vulnerable to corruption.
            <br/><br/>
            IT and Internet revolution also improves the speed of the entire process.
            With the help of mobile phone, mobile apps and better internet connectivity 
            businesses and government are able to reach indivduals within milliseconds.
            Operational speed of systems got improved exponentially and corruption got 
            minimized with the help of digital systems but still database administrator 
            holds to potential to change or corrupt the data. This is the limitation of centralized system.
            <br/><br/>
            In 2008, with bitcoin launch, blockchain technology remain no longer a concept. In 2015, Etherium helps people build custom 
            smart contracts.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Solution with AI and Blockchain</b>
            <br/><br/>
            The problem of identification of right people for right purpose can be solved by Artificial Intelligence and 
            the problem regarding correctness of it's credibility can be solved by block-chain. We can provide that benefit
            to everyone with the help of mobile phone and internet very efficiently in the current modern economy.
            It means we have the capability to target the individual and plan their upliftment with the help of mobile apps and internet.

            <b>@linkhelp.app and utility of thought in administration</b>
            <br/>
            <p>What is the utility of thought ? How @linkhelp.app helps us utilize the power of thoughts in order to reduce suffering at massive social scale.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The purpose of thinking (thoughts) is to let the ideas die instead of us dying&rdquo;. - Alfred North Whitehead</p>
            <p>We create simulation of events in our head before taking action in order to prevent ourselves from failure. Earlier, when we were chimps this ability to think prevent us from death. It allow us to function properly in the world as well. Everything we saw in human civilization was once a thought in someone's mind.</p>
            <p>Everyone is the unconscious exponent of a dead philosopher. - Nietzsche</p>
            <p>For thought to exist there must be two observer and observant, say you find yourself at a place where there exist nothing, still it can be represented as a thought because there exist &quot;no&quot; + &quot;thing&quot; you already saw.</p>
            <p>A logic is the sub class of thoughts or a hierarchy of thoughts where some thoughts are assumed as true in order to derive more thoughts.</p>
            <p>Foundation of each possible thought exist has two possible roots either observer equals to observant or observer is not equals to observant.</p>
            <p>if observer is not observant then thoughts can be used to describe such incident. (thought means everything comes in your mind including emotions because they can also be represented and imagined via thoughts)</p>
            <p>This is the foundation of world we interact which is based on duality. This can be formulated with any logical framework such as mathematics and can be simulated with powerful AI.</p>
            <p>if observer is equals to observant then thoughts will get collapsed to &quot;0&quot; as there is nothing outside to observe.</p>
            <p>There can't be birth or death, nothing can be added or subtracted so there can't be any suffering and conflicts. (pain and suffering are different, suffering is mental, pain is physical)</p>
            <p>This state is referred as state of enlightenment by religious people as this state eliminates the suffering. According to them, body is mortal hence it can never be totally protected so protecting the body can't be the main goal but a life without suffering and conflicts can be a better goal.</p>
            <p>Hence achieving the state can be the best possible goal as it's result is instant and independent from the outside world.</p>
            <p>This is the main root level concept of non duality. This can not be formulated with any logical framework, hence can't be simulated with AI.</p>
            <p>Duality and non duality aren't binary there exist a spectrum.</p>
            <p>The attraction or tendency to flow towards the state of non duality is defined as &quot;love&quot; by them as there won't be any conflicts in that state. The level up to which you reach in the spectrum is known as understanding.</p>
            <p>More understanding means lesser conflicts and more clarity. At fundamental level, we try to understand the things we are afraid of.</p>
            <p>There might be possible that your understanding is wrong factually because earlier we use to think space time is absolute as defined by Newton then Einstein came up with the concept of space-time (based on fundamental assumption was speed of light is constant throughout the universe) but there exist no one who suffers due to not knowing that fact.</p>
            <p>Space time absoluteness which was once a fact not a fact anymore. Fact is not truth, fact is observational data dependent.</p>
            <p>People argue big bang theory is true but the data we collect from the universe is an incident happened millions and billions of light years ago. We don't have the data what is currently happening at that place. Einstein's equations can't explain black hole dark energy etc which result in theory of parallel universe as well. So, we actually don't know, it is just the prediction based on the data we gathered and we can't even gather the current data as well because light can't reaching our telescope as things are million light years away as well. It is the most possible right assumption according to data we gather.</p>
            <p>But does anyone cares about absoluteness in facts or suffers due to that ? Absolutely No.</p>
            <p>We mostly cares about whether something is useful for us or not.</p>
            <p>Even with the concept of god, We don't care about god if god is indifferent towards our existence and not useful for us. Simply, it means &quot;usefulness&quot; is more important than &quot;god&quot; itself.</p>
            <p>One way to reduce suffering or conflict is by reducing the importance of things exists in duality. If knowledge of absoluteness of space time is not harming one then there is no need to have conflicts or suffering due to that.</p>
            <p>Higher in the spectrum you go in the spectrum of understanding lesser the suffering due to conflicts because of loss in the importance of things. If you don't even consider your body and mind as important than you are free from unnecessary bondage because anyway it's going to die and there is no reason to stress about anything as everything gets destroyed by the death.</p>
            <p>From above we found that &quot;thoughts&quot; are only important for the things we consider &quot;useful&quot;.</p>
            <p>We can broadly classify the usage of thoughts into following</p>
            <p>1. Thoughts can help us reduce or increase suffering by increasing or decreasing the importance of the things.</p>
            <p>2. Hierarchy of thoughts can help us create a logical framework in order to process incoming information from world and also help us create a specific outcomes from given inputs.</p>
            <p>Processing incoming information with logical framework helps us navigate through life and discover and learn new things.</p>
            <p>Creating specific outcome from given inputs helps us invent new things like new tools, new methods to do something.</p>
            <p>if increase the importance of useful things then we can reduce suffering and make things better.</p>
            <p>if increase the importance of non useful things then we will increase suffering and make things worse.</p>
            <p>Everyone in society can't be at the same level of understanding about everything at same time but democracy suggest every person opinion must have equal value which is very inefficient. That's why people created the Republic system where people have equal weight of votes to elect leaders in order to make social decisions which turned out as more efficient.</p>
            <p>With internet where access to information is available in milliseconds, we can do better than that,</p>
            <p>1. by allowing people with specific area of expertise to make specific social decisions for a specific community group.</p>
            <p>But here comes another glitch, making and implementing decisions are fairly different. We can make best decisions possible but still we can't implement them without consensus.</p>
            <p>For that, people created the concept of right to education and other kinds of rights in order for them to process the difference between &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;. At fundamental level people need &quot;HELP&quot;.</p>
            <p>2. by giving more weight-age to the opinion of &quot;helpful&quot; person as that person knows how to implement the right decision</p>
            <p>A best possible combination to make social decision must be</p>
            <p>&quot;Giving more power or weight to the vote of the person who helped the most in a particular area&quot;</p>
            <p>This is what we can do with @linkhelp.app by</p>
            <p>1. Creating a discussion forum where different people can post their opinions and methods to process the issues better.</p>
            <p>2. Creating a poll where people can vote and &quot;weight-age of their vote in a given context&quot; must be highly co-related to their &quot;helpfulness in given domain&quot;.</p>

           <b>@dateze.app and utility of communication and understanding of self in dating</b>
           <p>How to find right partner ? How dateze.app helps you in that ?</p>
           <p>Q. Why we need to find partner?</p>
           <p>A. At the level of biology or physicality, we have two purpose &quot;survival&quot; and other is &quot;reproduce&quot; just like any other animal.</p>
           <p>Having a partner or multiple partners improve the probability of the survival of individual and reproduction helps to improve the probability of survival of entire species. That's why only 3% species form one-one or monogamy format of relationships as nobody wish to reduce their survival probability.</p>
           <p>Q. What will happen if we don't have any partner in the &quot;modern world&quot; ?</p>
           <p>A. Nothing, not having partner won't reduce your probability of survival, neither reduce the probability of survival of entire species in the modern world.</p>
           <p>Q. What are the consequences of not having a partner?</p>
           <p>Consequences of not having a partner : </p>
           <p>(i) Physical level : Nothing, no one die without a partner</p>
           <p>(ii) Mental level : Loneliness.</p>
           <p>Q. What is loneliness ?</p>
           <p>A. A state of mind felt due to isolation from living beings.</p>
           <p>Q. Is it possible to get isolated from living beings?</p>
           <p>A. Isolation is a myth. No species can exist at total isolation at absolute level as you are home to trillions of microorganisms and our survival is dependent upon them. At social level we still need to interact with people. So, isolation is not possible.</p>
           <p>Q. Is it possible to feel lonely if people are around but still you can't share anything?</p>
           <p>A. Yes, this is the real cause of loneliness.</p>
           <p>Q. Why we don't share what we feel with other people ?</p>
           <p>A. Our past data about life suggest that other person will not understand us.</p>
           <p>Q. Are there people exist who understand us ?A. Yes, but understanding isn't binary, it's a spectrum. Some people understand us more and some people less.</p>
           <p>Q. How one humans understand other human ?</p>
           <p>A. By asking set of right questions.</p>
           <p>Q. Does an average person understand you better than psychologists and counselor ?</p>
           <p>A. No, because psychologists and counselor had better set of questions to diagnose the correct issue and that set of question also helps improve person's understanding</p>
           <p>Q. Can AI ask the right set of questions better and reduce loneliness ?</p>
           <p>A. Obviously Yes, AI can hold and process more data than average. Chatting with someone with whom you can share anything also reduce loneliness and if person can't distinguish the difference between chatting with AI and the person which is possible in future then yes it can reduce loneliness. (Turing test)</p>
           <p>Deeper someone understand you, lesser loneliness you feel.</p>
           <p>In future say after 100-200 years, for &quot;survival&quot; we will going to have a good health care system, for &quot;reproduction&quot; we will going to have &quot;artificial wombs&quot; (already created for lambs) and for loneliness (good amount of psychologists and AI bots, even human bots made up of biochemical materials can give same feeling as humans).</p>
           <p>So, if your life purpose or your identity is limited to yourself or average level functioning of body and mind or you can take care of yourself mentally and physically then you will not need any partner.</p>
           <p>Purpose is identity dependent and identity is also purpose dependent (if you identify yourself as a student then only your purpose is to study or if your purpose is to study then you can be identified as a student)</p>
           <p>Q. Where does identity exists ?</p>
           <p>A. If I hit your head with baseball bat and you lost your memory then you will forget your identities. Identity is memory dependent or dependent upon your mind. Till now definition of self is limited to body and mind in order to ensure it's survival.</p>
           <p>Q. What is the criteria of identifying something as ours ?</p>
           <p>A. When I say this is my motorcycle or this is my hand or this is mine then fundamental assumption is that I have some control over it. We can take motorcycle wherever we want and we can use our hands in whatever way we like etc.</p>
           <p>Q. Do we have absolute control over whatever we call as ours ?</p>
           <p>A. No, we have the limited control over everything, say you call a motorcycle as yours and you went crazy about the design of tyres and replace the circular type with rectangular one. Is it something useful you did or you made that motorcycle useless.</p>
           <p>Our identity is already bigger than our body and mind as we identify ourselves with the things we collected or everything we control. We call our body and mind as ours because we have some control over it.</p>
           <p>Q. Can we extend our identity beyond ourselves? Is it beneficial?</p>
           <p>A. Yes we can identify everything we control as ours and it is beneficial for us. We call tree as ours and then we use it to make furniture in the home.</p>
           <p>We already knows that extending identity is beneficial for us in case of materials. It can be beneficial to extend our identity to other people as well.</p>
           <p>It is the reason behind every possible development in the human civilization.</p>
           <p>People identify themselves as a group or community &quot;properly&quot; end up uniting everyone into a more stable society and when they identify &quot;improperly&quot; end up dividing or destroying everything.</p>
           <p>It is even true with the case of identification with materials as utilizing natural resources properly lead to better environment and improper utilization lead to disaster.</p>
           <p>So, what is the right way to extend our identity beyond ourselves ?</p>
           <p>The way of identification with the other is known as &quot;relationship&quot;.</p>
           <p>The right way to extend our identity beyond self in order to benefit the other is called &quot;love&quot;.</p>
           <p>Extending our identity beyond self in right way requires</p>
           <p>(i) understanding of self : done by questioning regarding self.</p>
           <p>(ii) understanding the right way to extend our identity. : done by establishing proper communication with other and questioning about the right way.</p>
           <p>(iii) understanding of &quot;what is beneficial&quot; for other.</p>
