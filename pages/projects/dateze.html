        In Dating, we match everything other than EQ of individuals which is the reason no matter how much planning,
        plotting or whatever kind of arrangement we do, still everything result into immense struggle. We just believe 
        that being mentally stable is almost impossible as we don't value spirituality in our life as the core. We remain 
        operated by compulsiveness instead of consciousness which result in making big issues out of temporary situations 
        which are even supposed to be ignored but we keep our mind busy into those non essential things due to lack of understanding
        regarding mental issues. Mental health is also considered as a non issue which is also a big problem sometimes things stop 
        responding properly at the level of brain itself and we just keep consulting people and think why behaviour isn't improving.
        So, we have both Questions feature for improving understanding regarding mental issues and how mind actually works and Counselling
        feature for Mental health. The compatibility in the relationship has a lot to do with the emotional intelligence quotient (EQ) 
        of the individuals. Two individuals with higher EQ can form great relationship as they can handle conflicts and differences better.
