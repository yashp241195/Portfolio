        When we start working in the market directly (especially in non conventional field like any Artistic area) we are surrounded with few major challenges like finding the suitable clients 
        and getting the payment on time, finding people with similar and complementary skill set with whom we can build and sustain small business, transparency of financial distribution among 
        the partners in that small business etc. With blockchain driven smart contracts we can guarantee timely payment and transparency in financial distribution among partners and also allow 
        each member to trace the history of financial distribution and the company's public group chat with the help of a smart contract named "Crystal". This history of accountability also encourages
        investors to evaluate early stage startups more conveniently which might speed up entire investment process. Ease in starting and sustaining business during initial days determine the economic 
        growth of entire country which is the real motto of Artistt app to empower people do what they love.
