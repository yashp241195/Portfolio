    <p>At @workoso.app, we can help people find work more easily and improve the ease of doing business  </p>
    <p>1. People can find jobs, freelance works etc and understand the demands of particular services according to their geography.</p>
    <p>2. People can connect with each other and get access to their work reviews in order to understand the credibility of a person.</p>
    <p>3. We allow people to create their own services and collaborate with other people on their own terms and up to a particular period with the help of &quot;SERVICE ORIENTED&quot; architecture for work (every work should be done by a service.) which solves the issue of speed of team formation.</p>
    <p>For example. A team of 2 people providing service A of good quality can collaborate with a team of 3 providing some complementary service B of good quality can work together as a Company Z and produce better results with the help of SERVICE ORIENTED architecture.</p>
    <p>It will improve the infrastructure more efficiently as the speed of going from step 1-6 </p>
    <p>To understand this better or how we came up to this point, please refer <b> CivilizationType1 </b> section</p>
