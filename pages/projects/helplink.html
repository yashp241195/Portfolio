        Helplink can implement democracy at large scale, our current system is republic where selected representatives makes social decision. 
        In Helplink, people who know and helped most in the given field, say "education" must hold more weight-age in the decision related to education. 
        This blockchain driven context based weighted votes opinion poles can change the entire political structure where people who helped the most 
        make decisions not the group or a party where only few people did the real work and rest have no clue why they joined the political party at the 
        first place which is the core reason no matter whom we elect that person ruin the system instead of making it better. The problem exist in the 
        structure itself where Kejriwal can't execute anything without becoming mini version of Narendra Modi (one who over promise to get more votes). 
        Helplink is the solution not only for politics but to any form of group whether it is political party, corporations, community group/social groups 
        where we need to make collaborative decisions.
