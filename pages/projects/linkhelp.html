    <p>We can broadly classify the usage of thoughts into following</p>
    <p>1. Thoughts can help us reduce or increase suffering by increasing or decreasing the importance of the things.</p>
    <p>2. Hierarchy of thoughts can help us create a logical framework in order to process incoming information from world and also help us create a specific outcomes from given inputs.</p>
    <p>Processing incoming information with logical framework helps us navigate through life and discover and learn new things.</p>
    <p>Creating specific outcome from given inputs helps us invent new things like new tools, new methods to do something.</p>
    <p>if we increase the importance of useful things then we can reduce suffering and make things better.</p>
    <p>if we increase the importance of non useful things then we will increase suffering and make things worse.</p>
    <p>Everyone in society can't be at the same level of understanding about everything at same time but democracy suggest every person opinion must have equal value which is very inefficient. That's why people created the Republic system where people have equal weight of votes to elect leaders in order to make social decisions which turned out as more efficient.</p>
    <p>With internet where access to information is available in milliseconds, we can do better than that,</p>
    <p>1. by allowing people with specific area of expertise to make specific social decisions for a specific community group.</p>
    <p>But here comes another glitch, making and implementing decisions are fairly different. We can make best decisions possible but still we can't implement them without consensus.</p>
    <p>For that, people created the concept of right to education and other kinds of rights in order for them to process the difference between &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;. At fundamental level people need &quot;HELP&quot;.</p>
    <p>2. by giving more weight-age to the opinion of &quot;helpful&quot; person as that person knows how to implement the right decision</p>
    <p>A best possible combination to make social decision must be</p>
    <p>&quot;Giving more power or weight to the vote of the person who helped the most in a particular area&quot;</p>
    <p>This is what we can do with @linkhelp.app by</p>
    <p>1. Creating a discussion forum where different people can post their opinions and methods to process the issues better.</p>
    <p>2. Creating a poll where people can vote and &quot;weight-age of their vote in a given context&quot; must be highly co-related to their &quot;helpfulness in given domain&quot;.</p>
